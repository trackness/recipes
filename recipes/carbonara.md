* Sriracha, 4 tbsp

## steps
1. In a cold large skillet, add the olive oil and the pancetta / lardons / bacon and set to low-medium heat. Cook until lightly caremalised, and the fat is rendered, approx. 25 to 30 minutes.

2. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a low boil, cover, and keep hot on a low burner.

3. Whisk together the chili garlic sauce and miso paste until smooth, then beat in the eggs and pepper.

4. Cook the pasta until al dente and drain, reserving the cooking liquid. Return the pasta to the cooking pot, but off the cook top.

5. Tempur the sauce by slowly pouring in a small amount of the pasta water while whisking.

6. Pour the sauce into the pasta, and continually toss until the eggs coat the pasta.

7. Repeat with the grated parmesan, and slowly add pasta water until the sauce is emulsified, but not too loose.

8. Combine the pancetta / lardons / bacon, including the fat, into the pasta, adding more pasta water as needed to maintain the desired sauce consistency.
